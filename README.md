# Python Hello World Example

This repository contains a minimal "Hello, World!" implementation in Python, demonstrating clean code organization with modern Python practices.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

1. Demonstrate the minimal code required to write and run a Python program
2. Serve as a basic test for Python development environments
3. Provide a starting point for learning and experimentation

## Running the Program

### Linux/macOS
```bash
# Using Python 3 (recommended)
python3 main.py

# If Python 3 is the default
python main.py

# Using the script directly (requires executable permissions)
chmod +x main.py
./main.py
```

### Windows
```cmd
# Using Python 3
python main.py

# Using Python Launcher for Windows
py main.py
```

## Contributing

While this repository aims to maintain minimalism, bug fixes and improvements to documentation are welcome. Please ensure any changes maintain the simplicity of the example.
